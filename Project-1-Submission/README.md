# Welcome to Fresh Tomatoes


This application will allow you to display posters for your favorite movies in  
the browser, and display each movie's trailer when the poster is clicked.

#### How to make it work

> Assuming the requirements below are met, navigate to entertainment_center.py and  
> type <code>python entertainment_center.py</code>. This will build a file named  
> fresh_tomatoes.html which will be displayed in the default browser.

> To add movies, open entertainment_center.py and follow the directions at the top.

## Requirements
### Python 3

You will need Python3 to run this application.

To check your version of python to to the terminal in Linux/MacOs and type

 <code>python --version</code>

If some version of python 3 isn't displayed, try typing

 <code>python3 --version</code>.

If you still have no luck, follow the Python3 download instructions [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Terminal Access

To run the application, navigate to its containing folder in the terminal, type  
<code>python entertainment_center.py</code> and watch the magic.

### Text Editor

To add movies it is necessary for now to manipulate the entertainment_center.py  
file itself with a text editor. Anything will do as long as it can open a file  
add text, and save the file (as a .py file). Instructions for adding movies to  
the list are in entertainment_center.py, at the top.

#### Known issues:
- Inability to open application from GUI
- Difficulty modifying list of movies.
  - Building the list of movies could be  
automated
  - Acessing the list for editing could be accomplished through the browser
  - Storing the list can be done using a database.
- This application does not reside on a server yet, which would fix most  
of the currently known issues.
